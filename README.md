# Mental-health conditions and risk of subsequent self-harm, assault, and unintentional injuries: Longitudinal whole-nation registry analyses in two countries

# Project abstract
Mental-health conditions are associated with increased risk of chronic physical diseases, but their implications for other physical-health outcomes, including injuries, are less established. In this prospective cohort study, we tested whether mental-health conditions antedate unintentional as well as self-harm and assault injuries, using administrative data from Norway (N=2,753,646) and New Zealand (N=2,238,813). In Norway, after accounting for pre-existing injuries, individuals with a primary-care encounter for a mental-health condition subsequently had elevated risk of primary care-recorded injury. In New Zealand, as expected, individuals with a mental health inpatient-hospital admission had elevated risk of subsequent inpatient hospital-recorded self-harm injury, as well as assault injury. However, they also had elevated risk of unintentional injuries. Associations extended to injury-insurance claims. Across nations, associations were evident across mental-health conditions, sex, age, and after accounting for indicators of socioeconomic background. Injuries particularly involved the brain and head. Mental-health patients are an important group for injury prevention.
